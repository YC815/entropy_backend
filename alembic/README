Generic single-database configuration for Alembic.

# Alembic Database Migrations

## Usage

### Create a new migration

Auto-generate a migration based on model changes:
```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description of changes"
```

### Apply migrations

Apply all pending migrations:
```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

### Rollback migrations

Rollback one migration:
```bash
alembic downgrade -1
```

Rollback to a specific revision:
```bash
alembic downgrade <revision_id>
```

### View migration history

```bash
alembic history
```

### View current revision

```bash
alembic current
```

## Important Notes

- Always review auto-generated migrations before applying them
- Test migrations in a development environment first
- Alembic reads DATABASE_URL from app.core.config.settings
- Migration files are stored in alembic/versions/
